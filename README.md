# Campus-Placement-Prediction

Problem Statement:
The Placement of students is one of the most important objective of an educational
institution. Reputation and yearly admissions of an institution invariably depend on the
placements it provides it students with. That is why all the institutions, arduously, strive
to strengthen their placement department so as to improve their institution on a whole.
Any assistance in this particular area will have a positive impact on an institutionâ€™s ability
to place its students. This will always be helpful to both the students, as well as the
institution.

The main goal is to predict whether the student will be recruited in campus placements
or not based on the available factors in the dataset.
